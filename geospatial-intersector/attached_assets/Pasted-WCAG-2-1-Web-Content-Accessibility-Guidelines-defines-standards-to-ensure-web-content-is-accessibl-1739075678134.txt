WCAG 2.1 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) defines standards to ensure web content is accessible to a wider range of users, including those with disabilities. Regarding tooltips, they can be used to provide additional information, but to meet WCAG 2.1 AAA (the highest level of conformance), you must ensure that tooltips are accessible.

Here are the relevant points to consider:

1. Text Contrast (Success Criterion 1.4.6, AAA)
Tooltips must have sufficient contrast between the text and the background. For AAA, the contrast ratio must be at least 7:1 between the text and the background.

2. Keyboard Accessibility (Success Criterion 2.1.1, A)
Tooltips must be accessible via keyboard. Users who rely on a keyboard should be able to trigger and dismiss tooltips without requiring a mouse (e.g., using the Tab key or a keyboard shortcut).

3. Visibility and Focus (Success Criterion 1.4.13, AA)
For WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, tooltips should:

Be dismissible: Users should be able to dismiss them without moving the pointer or keyboard focus (e.g., pressing Esc).
Be hoverable: If a tooltip is triggered by hover, the tooltip should remain visible while the user moves the mouse pointer over it.
Be persistent: Tooltips should remain visible for long enough to be read (shouldn't disappear too quickly).
For AAA, you must ensure:

The tooltip remains visible as long as the element has focus or is being hovered over.
Tooltips should not be solely based on hover events as they are not accessible for mobile or touch-screen users.
4. Timing (Success Criterion 2.2.5, AAA)
Content that appears on hover or focus (like tooltips) should not disappear until the user dismisses it. If the tooltip contains critical information, ensure the user has sufficient time to interact with it.

5. Tooltip Structure (Success Criterion 1.3.1, A)
Tooltips should be structured in a way that makes them readable by screen readers. Use ARIA attributes such as aria-describedby to associate the tooltip with the element it describes.

6. Screen Reader Compatibility
Ensure the tooltips are compatible with screen readers. You can use ARIA roles and attributes like role="tooltip", and aria-hidden="false" to ensure that screen readers can recognize and announce tooltips.
